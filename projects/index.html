<h2 id=civil-service-acronym-buster-linkhttpssamuel-hoskingithubiocs-acronyms>Civil Service Acronym Buster (<a href=https://samuel-hoskin.github.io/CS-Acronyms/>Link</a>)</h2>
<p>The Civil Service as an organisation, runs on Acronyms. Anyone new to a Department or area of work might think that their colleagues are speaking a different language.</p>
<p>This site attempts to document all the acronyms used in order to improve everyone‚Äôs understanding in the workplace.</p>
<h2 id=civil-service-behaviour-helper-linkhttpssamuel-hoskingithubiocs-behaviour-page>Civil Service Behaviour Helper (<a href=https://samuel-hoskin.github.io/CS-Behaviour-Page/>Link</a>)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do you struggle to write Civil Service Behaviours?</li>
<li>Do you find it difficult to flip thought all the different documents?</li>
<li>Want something easy to refernce when writing objectives?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is static web page that brings together all of the key documents you need when you are writing Behaviours based statements.
I made this page to help me as I struggled with problems above and I hoping it can help others.</p>
<h2 id=in-the-works-projects>&lsquo;In the Works&rsquo; Projects</h2>
<p>I have quite a few ideas that are in various degrees of development.</p>
<h3 id=--air-quality-moniter>- Air Quality Moniter</h3>
<p>Spaned from the idea of tracking indoor office air quailty and then displaying the data. Learning about large scale data, nodes, apis, Data UI and much more. I do think, I might have set my ambition high for this one but I am enjoying comeing back to it every now and again with a fresh mind set and diffrent approach to solve things.</p>
<h3 id=--network-maintainer>- Network Maintainer</h3>
<p>I am forgetful person and there lots of people that I want to catch up and talk with regualrly. I forgot to message or ararange something, time passes and I feel arkward reaching out as it has been left for so long. the MVP of this is a web app that I cn list people, say how often I would like to speak to them, know the last date I did, and then then send me an email in x weeks/months time to remind me to reach out them, arange a coffee or lunch etc! Step 2 of this would be allowing others to use it, but that involves user accounts so I am not thinking about that right now!</p>
<h3 id=--coffee-roulette>- Coffee Roulette</h3>
<p>MVP - Py Script to randomly connect people ever X ammount of time, send them an email and possible rememeber the previous X amount of connections so that the same people dont get matched
Step 2 - Web App Version
I have seen people do this mannually and annoys me as it could be an automated but the existing solutions on the market are way too over priced so I want to make an open-source version, Should not be too hard&mldr; he said before he started</p>
<h3 id=--cs-network--community-list>- CS Network / Community List</h3>
<p>Taking a tangent from someone elses idea, but would allow Dept and X-gov networks to post themselves so there one site that list all the amazing networks and communityes in govemrent. Primary drives behinf this is discoverability and x-gov join-up and idea shareing. An addional benefit is that it could be used as part of recuitment to say &ldquo;look at the amazing and varied networks the dept/CS have to offer&rdquo;</p>
