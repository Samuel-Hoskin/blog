Ahead of me starting my new role, I wanted to set up a place where I could start writing weeknotes or publish/develop any thoguhts that I had in the open.

My goal is complete this weekly (Duh-hoy if you weeknotes) and that is it. So I expect varing decree of post lenght, depth and insight.

The reason I want to do this is that I forgot things very easy. So when it comes reflecting back, my mind often draws a blank. These posts, however breif, will hopefully poke my brain to rember all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) work, ideas and expreinces that I have.
