Most of my projects come from me going "... that would be really useful thing" and then trying to build it.

## Civil Service Acronym Buster ([Link](https://samuel-hoskin.github.io/CS-Acronyms/))

The Civil Service as an organisation, runs on Acronyms. Anyone new to a Department or area of work might think that their colleagues are speaking a different language.

This site attempts to document all the acronyms used in order to improve everyoneâ€™s understanding in the workplace.

## Civil Service Behaviour Helper ([Link](https://samuel-hoskin.github.io/CS-Behaviour-Page/))

- Do you struggle to write Civil Service Behaviours?
- Do you find it difficult to flip thought all the different documents?
- Want something easy to refernce when writing objectives?

This is static web page that brings together all of the key documents you need when you are writing Behaviours based statements.
I made this page to help me as I struggled with problems above and I hoping it can help others.

## 'In the Works' Projects

I have quite a few ideas that are in various degrees of development.

### - Air Quality Moniter
Spaned from the idea of tracking indoor office air quailty and then displaying the data. Learning about large scale data, nodes, apis, Data UI and much more. I do think, I might have set my ambition high for this one but I am enjoying comeing back to it every now and again with a fresh mind set and diffrent approach to solve things. 

### - Network Maintainer
I am forgetful person and there lots of people that I want to catch up and talk with regualrly. I forgot to message or ararange something, time passes and I feel arkward reaching out as it has been left for so long. the MVP of this is a web app that I cn list people, say how often I would like to speak to them, know the last date I did, and then then send me an email in x weeks/months time to remind me to reach out them, arange a coffee or lunch etc! Step 2 of this would be allowing others to use it, but that involves user accounts so I am not thinking about that right now!

### - Coffee Roulette
MVP - Py Script to randomly connect people ever X ammount of time, send them an email and possible rememeber the previous X amount of connections so that the same people dont get matched
Step 2 - Web App Version
I have seen people do this mannually and annoys me as it could be an automated but the existing solutions on the market are way too over priced so I want to make an open-source version, Should not be too hard... he said before he started

### - CS Network / Community List
Taking a tangent from someone elses idea, but would allow Dept and X-gov networks to post themselves so there one site that list all the amazing networks and communityes in govemrent. Primary drives behinf this is discoverability and x-gov join-up and idea shareing. An addional benefit is that it could be used as part of recuitment to say "look at the amazing and varied networks the dept/CS have to offer"
